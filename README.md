# Angular CV For Volume
 As part of a tech test for Volume, I've created an Angular based representation of my CV

 It's a little tricky to say the exact time I spent on the project and how exactly that time was allocated, as I've been pretty sick while working on it and it was spread across two days.

 I would estimate that about an hour and a half was spent creating the structure of the site. A couple hours spent playing with css and html to get it looking a way that I was happy with. Around an hour spent fiddling with the typescript to get things like the different backgrounds, the image carousel on the home page and the cv-reader-service working. I then spent a further half hour just playing about with the site and making a few final tweaks.

 I'm pretty happy with the end result although I'm never 100% happy with the outcome on work like this.
